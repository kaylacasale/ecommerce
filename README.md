## Description
E-Commerce web development has two faces- 1) Front-end development 2) Back-end development. This application focuses on the back-end using MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect the Express.js API to a MySQL database and the `dotenv` package to use environment variables to store sensitive data (e.g. username, password, and database name). Lastly, using any API platform that allows developers to design, build, test, and iterate their APIs (e.g. Insomnia), I test all controller routes (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) through **Postman**.
